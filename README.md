# Coffee_shop_Dashboard
I have analyzed and visualized data for a coffee shop, creating an interactive Excel dashboard. This includes:

- An hourly line chart to describe sales trends throughout the day.
- A chart showing the category with the highest sales percentage.
- An analysis of the top 5 products based on sales and footfall.
- Sales comparisons across various store locations.
- Slicers to filter data by day or month for detailed insights.

This dashboard helps the coffee shop identify peak sales hours, popular product categories, and high-performing products, enabling better inventory management, targeted promotions, and strategic decision-making to enhance overall sales performance.
